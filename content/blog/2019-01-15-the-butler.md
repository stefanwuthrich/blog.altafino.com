Altafino - Means in esperanto "High-End". I choosed this name for my company to bring over my vision of delivering high-end [software solutions](https://www.altafino.com).

What never really followed this vision, was company's own website (first under altafino.co.uk, now www.altafino.com). So finally I invested in working with an expert for doing clean and nice web-sites, [Alina Sava](https://sava.io) â€” digital designer, developer & product maker based in Berlin.

She did completly new design, starting with a new logo, defined new simpler structure of content and navigation and implemented the full site.

I'm very happy with the new page, which now is inline with the meaning of _altafino_ - _high end_.
