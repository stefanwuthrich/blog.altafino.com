Altafino means "High-End" in Esperanto. I chose this name for my company to bring over my vision of delivering high-end [software solutions](https://www.altafino.com).

What never really followed this vision, was company's own website (first under altafino.co.uk, now www.altafino.com). So finally I invested in a professional website, which was done by [Alina Sava](https://sava.io) &mdash; a digital designer, developer & product maker based in Berlin.

She completely redesigned everything, starting with a new logo, restructured content and navigation and implemented the full site.

I'm very happy with the new design, which now is inline with the meaning of altafino.
